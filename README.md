# Project: Landing Page

A simple landing page made for the [Odin Project Foundations Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page) that utilizes the skills I've learned thus far. Mainly about **flexbox** and the CSS Foundations.

NOTE TO FUTURE SELF: Will definitely update or create a similar project again, but for now I just want to go through the curriculum while enjoying the summer break.
